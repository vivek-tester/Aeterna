# Accessibility Features in Aeterna

This document outlines the comprehensive accessibility features implemented in the Aeterna YouTube Music client to ensure an inclusive experience for all users.

## Overview

Aeterna is designed with accessibility as a core principle, implementing WCAG 2.1 AA standards and Material Design accessibility guidelines. The app provides multiple accessibility modes and supports various assistive technologies.

## Key Accessibility Features

### 1. High Contrast Mode
- **Purpose**: Improves visibility for users with low vision or color blindness
- **Implementation**: 
  - Enhanced color contrast ratios (7:1 for high contrast mode, 4.5:1 for normal mode)
  - Automatic color adjustment based on background
  - Increased elevation and shadows for better element distinction
- **Location**: Settings > Accessibility > High Contrast Mode

### 2. TalkBack and Screen Reader Support
- **Semantic Descriptions**: Every UI element has meaningful content descriptions
- **Role Assignments**: Proper semantic roles (Button, Slider, Tab, etc.)
- **Navigation**: Logical focus order and navigation flow
- **Announcements**: Live updates and state changes are announced

### 3. Reduce Motion
- **Purpose**: Helps users with vestibular disorders or motion sensitivity
- **Implementation**:
  - Disables or reduces animations and transitions
  - Removes parallax effects and auto-playing content
  - Maintains functionality while minimizing motion
- **Location**: Settings > Accessibility > Reduce Motion

### 4. Large Text Support
- **Dynamic Text Scaling**: Respects system font size preferences
- **Enhanced Typography**: Bolder fonts in high contrast mode
- **Readable Line Heights**: Optimized spacing for readability
- **Minimum Touch Targets**: 48dp minimum for all interactive elements

### 5. Touch and Gesture Accessibility
- **Minimum Touch Targets**: All interactive elements are at least 48dp
- **Gesture Alternatives**: Button alternatives for all gesture-based actions
- **Haptic Feedback**: Configurable haptic feedback for interactions
- **Voice Control**: Full voice navigation support

## Component-Specific Features

### Music Player
- **Play/Pause Button**: Clear semantic labels and state announcements
- **Seek Bar**: Position and duration information for screen readers
- **Skip Controls**: Descriptive labels ("Skip to next song", "Skip to previous song")
- **Volume Control**: Announced volume level changes
- **Shuffle/Repeat**: Clear state descriptions

### Song Lists and Cards
- **Song Information**: Complete song details in content descriptions
- **Playlist Context**: Playlist information and song count
- **Currently Playing**: Clear indication of currently playing song
- **Album Artwork**: Descriptive alt text for album covers

### Search Interface
- **Search Suggestions**: Keyboard navigation support
- **Filter Options**: Clear labeling and state management
- **Results Announcement**: Search result count announcements
- **Voice Search**: Built-in voice search capabilities

### Navigation
- **Bottom Navigation**: Clear tab labels and selection states
- **Drawer Navigation**: Logical hierarchy and focus management
- **Breadcrumbs**: Clear navigation context
- **Back Navigation**: Consistent back button behavior

## Implementation Details

### AccessibilityUtils Class
```kotlin
// Contrast ratio calculation
fun getAccessibleColor(foreground: Color, background: Color, minimumContrast: Float): Color

// Duration formatting for screen readers
fun formatDurationForAccessibility(durationMs: Long): String

// Touch target size enforcement
val MinimumTouchTargetSize: Dp = 48.dp
```

### SemanticModifiers Object
```kotlin
// Semantic descriptions for common UI patterns
fun playButton(isPlaying: Boolean): Modifier
fun songItem(title: String, artist: String, duration: String, isPlaying: Boolean): Modifier
fun playlistItem(name: String, songCount: Int, isPrivate: Boolean): Modifier
```

### AccessibleComponents
- `AccessibleCard`: High contrast aware card component
- `AccessibleButton`: Contrast and touch target optimized button
- `AccessibleIconButton`: Icon button with enhanced semantics
- `AccessibleText`: Text with automatic contrast adjustment

## Data Persistence

### AccessibilityPreferencesDataStore
Accessibility settings are persisted using DataStore:
- High Contrast Mode preference
- Reduce Motion preference
- Large Text preference
- Screen Reader Optimization
- Haptic Feedback settings

## Testing

### Accessibility Tests
- Contrast ratio validation
- Semantic description completeness
- Touch target size verification
- Screen reader navigation testing
- Voice control functionality

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] TalkBack navigation works correctly
- [ ] All interactive elements are reachable
- [ ] Content descriptions are meaningful
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG standards
- [ ] Touch targets are appropriately sized
- [ ] Animations respect motion preferences
- [ ] Voice control commands work
- [ ] High contrast mode is functional

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers
1. **Always provide content descriptions** for meaningful UI elements
2. **Use semantic roles** appropriately (Button, Slider, Tab, etc.)
3. **Test with TalkBack enabled** during development
4. **Respect user preferences** for motion and contrast
5. **Ensure minimum touch target sizes** (48dp)
6. **Use AccessibilityUtils** for color contrast validation

### For Content Creators
1. **Provide meaningful song metadata** for screen reader users
2. **Include descriptive album artwork** descriptions
3. **Use clear, descriptive playlist names**
4. **Avoid relying solely on color** to convey information
