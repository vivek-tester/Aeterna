# GitHub Actions Build Test

This file is created to test the GitHub Actions build workflow.

Build initiated at: 2025-09-27

## Expected Workflow Steps:
1. ✅ Checkout code
2. ✅ Set up JDK 17
3. ✅ Make gradlew executable  
4. ✅ Debug Gradle configuration
5. ✅ Clean Gradle cache
6. ✅ Build with Gradle (assembleDebug)
7. ✅ Upload APK artifact

## Build Status:
- Status: 🎯 **SIMPLIFIED & STREAMLINED** - Minimal build approach at commit 61e310a
- Expected output: app-debug.apk artifact
- GitHub Action: **Running Core Build Only** 🚀

## Issue Resolution:
### ❌ **Persistent YAML Parsing Issue:**
```
Task ''--version' \ ' not found in root project 'Aeterna'
```

### 🧠 **Root Cause Analysis:**
- **Problem**: GitHub Actions YAML parser treating ALL commands as Gradle tasks
- **Issue**: Even explicit bash commands being misinterpreted
- **Impact**: Every command (--version, tasks, assembleDebug) seen as task names

### 🎯 **Final Solution Strategy:**
- **Approach**: MINIMIZE complexity - remove all problematic commands
- **Focus**: Single essential command: `./gradlew assembleDebug`
- **Method**: Explicit `shell: bash` directive for reliable execution
- **Philosophy**: Less complexity = fewer failure points

### 🔧 **Streamlined Workflow:**
1. **Debug Build Environment** - Basic environment verification
2. **Build Android APK** - Core build command ONLY
3. **Upload APK** - Artifact storage

**Key Change**: Removed all debugging commands that were causing parsing issues

## Latest Changes Pushed:
- 🔧 Fixed Gradle wrapper JAR missing from repository
- 📝 Updated build documentation with resolution details
- 🚀 Re-triggered automated CI/CD pipeline

## Monitor Build Progress:
🌐 **GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/vivek-tester/Aeterna/actions

**Expected Success**: APK should build successfully now with proper Gradle wrapper!
